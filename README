# Tool to try and convert NicoletOne binary files (.e) into .edf. It is a lossy conversion, just concatenates all segments it finds in the source file 
# and takes the 1-8 channels, assumes sampling of 500Hz (see convert.py). Could be useful for someone else starting making a serious converter.

# USAGE:
sh convert.sh <source.e> <out.edf>

# Beware that it uses the temporary folder tmp/ to write channels' CSV.
